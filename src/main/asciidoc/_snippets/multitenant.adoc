== Multi-tenant

Since version 1.3.0, there is a strategy to support multi tenant database.

=== How does it work?

This library creates one MongodbClient instance, this instance is used to
provide the database reference which is used by the collections injection.

The collection injector is a generic method which must be `@Dependent` scope
and cannot be `@RequestScoped` doing this provider not an option when a
multi-tenant behaviour is needed due to the database must be choose based on
each request. On the other hand, the database provider is not a generic
producer method allowing this to be scoped as `@RequestScoped` hitting the
connection to the database based on each request.

To achieve a multi-tenant behaviour, the library provide the option to specialize
the class `co.pablob.mongo.control.DatabaseNameProvider` which is in charge
to specify to the Database producer what is the database name.|
