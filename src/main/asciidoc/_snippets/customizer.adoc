== Customizer

In the case of the necessity to create an index the library provides an
interface which can be implemented and this will run as soon as the
`MongoDatabase` reference is created.

The interface `co.pablob.mongo.boundary.MongodbCustomizer` requires the
implementation of the method `customize` which receives a reference of the
database (`MongoDatabase`) to make the needed customizations like index
creation.
