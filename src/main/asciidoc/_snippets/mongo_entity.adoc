== The MongodbEntity interface

The Mongo entity interface gives to user the ability to create a
{json_and_bson_url}[BSON] object based on the POJO which implements the interface.

=== Why does this interface exist

The `MongodbEntity` was created to provide method `toDocument()` which will convert
the entity to a BSON object that can be created to save into database to get the
id, because over {pojo_codec}[POJO] codec is not possible to obtain the new ID
after save.
