=== Working with MongoDatabase

In case you need to work directly with the `MongoDatabase` instance, the injection of this instance is available by
`@Inject` cdi annotation.

[source,java]
----
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;

...
    @Inject
    private MongoDatabase database;
...
----

Above example will inject the *unique* instance of database which is share by the whole application.
